## Step 1 MetaMask
	To use DTOOLS you will need to download MetaMask and setup your own wallet as we will be using decentralised exchanges for our snipes.
		Skip to step two if you already have your own MetaMask wallet.
	Download MetaMask
	Import your wallet or setup a new one and write down your seedphrase somewhere secure.
## Step 2 Buy $DTOOLS
	In this step we will swap $DTOOLS for Eth
	Visit degnerate.tools and follow the link to the chart, to make sure you will swap the right token and avoid a scam token
	Follow the link to Uniswap, or copy the token address directly into uniswap.org
	Proceed to swap enough Eth to give you 1.5, 3.5 or 7.5 million $DTOOLS, depending on your chosen tier.
		Set your slippage to 0.5 to avoid Mev bots
	To confirm the transaction, you can view your recent transactions or import $DTOOLS into MetaMask to view your new balance.
		select 'import token' from the bottom of your MetaMask extesnion
		Select the 'Custom token' tab
		Paste the $DTOOLS token address under the field labelled 'Token contract address'
		Select 'Add custom token'
## Step 3 Connet wallet
	In this step we will connect our Etherium wallet to the DTOOLS bots so we can use the utility DTOOLS offers.
		It is recommended only to do this once you have enough DTOOLS. If you connect to the DTOOLS bots without enough DTOOLS, you may run into errors later on when you do have enough. To fix this issue it requires setting up a new telegram account from scratch with a new phone number, so double check your token balance before proceeding.
	First thing is to connect to the main telegram bot which gives you most functions to call like Gains analysis, Snipe Analysis and Sniper Sniffer.
	Go to degenerate.tools again and scroll down to Utility and select the telegram link on 'Multi-Wallet Swap.
